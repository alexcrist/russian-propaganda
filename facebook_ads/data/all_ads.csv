70,P(1)0002262,429,"Sadness and shocking tragedy at historically black church in Charlestone A white gunman opened a fire at pastor and 8 other church members at black church in Charlestone, S.0 on Wednesday night. The young clean-shaved shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people. Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be investigated as hate crime. Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American church which was found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822. Despite the first black American president, Africa-Americans remain the most common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-crimes? What if American racial change still occurs through generations? What of it racism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a deeply racist country?

Let's take a look at just how crazy this pledge gets. That's just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional amendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last decade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55 percent! But they don't stop there. NOM also wants candidates to ""work to overturn any Supreme Court decision"" in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants the president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans, but at this point, legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that supporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn't qualified to be a judge. Also, NOM wants the candidates to weaken civil rights laws, creating loopholes to let companies and citizens to discriminate if they cite a religious justification. That could actually happen — and it already has in some states — so it's a huge concern. And fifth, they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment against people who oppose marriage equality. Sure, gays and lesbians are harassed every day, fired, kicked out of their homes and schools, separated from their families, but I really hope soon there'll be NO MORE of it!

Sergeant Shane Ortega, 28, doesn't stand out or appear out of the ordinary among his fellow Army soldiers. But there's one thing that differs him from the bulk of troops. Shane is the first openly trans soldier of the US Army. He's astonishingly handsome, he works out constantly (check out his muscular build), he covered in tattoos, he's part black, Latino and Cherokee, he's obsessed with his girlfriend (a former model and aspiring doctor); and he gets giddy talking about both video games and chopping wood in Alaska. Yet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve, SGT Ortega has been at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army paperwork, he is identified as a woman. But the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for the transgender people in the military. And he succeeded!

Police said Ware ran into nearby woods and struggled with officers when they caught up with him. Officers sprayed him with oleoresin capsicum, more commonly known as pepper spray, according to police. The chemical agent debilitates a person by causing temporary blindness and irritating a person's nose and throat. The six officers who were involved in Ware's case will remain on duty during an investigation, according to police. Officials said police car dash cam and body camera footage of the incident would be released after that investigation. This tragedy happen accidentally, and probably the police officers didn't wish death upon him, because they tried to give him first aid. However, the man is dead and there is no chance to rewind and bring him back. He's gone forever, but the cops will remain on duty and get away with this murder. Is this acceptable?

People of color have been dealing with injustice ever since they crossed the North American continent.

Undoubtedly, black Americans were afraid of police, improper procedure, injustice or what is worse, being killed by police officer.

The second case over a week, huh? How retarded and/or brainwashed by Fox News is one supposed to be to believe this is a coincidence? No way we are gonna buy such bullshit. The weirdest thing about this specific case is that the suicide was committed just an hour after the arrest. Moreover, the woman was suspected of stealing someone's phone which is quite not a reason for getting to her account. We've got to also take into consideration that 1 in 3 black men go to prison as opposed to a considerably lower rate with the white men (http://www.alternet. org/story/154587/1 _in_3_black_men_g(:_to_prison_the_10_most_disturbing_ facts_about racial_inequality_in_the_u.s._criminal_justice_system).

The figure from the Census Bureau is a calculation of net migration—meaning the total number of immigrants who will arrive in the United States in 2015 would actually be larger than 1.24 million. Of course, the United States is the country of immigrants. But if America had huge undeveloped lands and needed workers at the earliest stage, today there is a jobs deficit. Today the government must restrict immigration that is a reason of interethnic tensions in the United States. High unemployment rate fuels intolerance toward immigrants that are ready to work illegally for low wages. So, besides social problem, immigrants threaten the U.S. economy. Those who work illegaly don't pay taxes that are an important part of state budget. Working illegaly, they break the law. Lack of immigration restrictions increases crime rates. Moreover, more and more immigrants cannot speak English. One-fifth of people in the United States speak a foreign language at home, according to a report of the Center for Immigration Studies. You see, increasing ammount of immigrants in the United States creates social and economic problems. However, we have a risk not only to worsen the U.S. economy, but also to lose our culture. America can't be the Tower of Babel, we cannot allow everybody to live here if immigration threatens us.

People trying to change the gender on a passport only need to be in transition, not post-surgery. But many transgender people never complete the surgery due to economical reasons, health issues etc. It seems that the law does not care about these people's circumstances. So typical of bureaucrats. It is very important for every transgender to be able to change his\her identification to reflect who they really are. It's not just about person dressed as a man one day and then dressed as a woman the next, or vice versa. It is about much more deep, more complex things. An authentic transgender man or woman only presents as the gender they truly are; And not the gender they were assigned to at birth.

Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening - by rejecting what they're hearing (""It's just a phase; you'll get over it""); by shutting down (""If you choose that lifestyle, I don't want to hear about it""); or by not registering the impact of what we're being told (""That's nice, dear, and what do you want for dinner?""). Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT children. If you as a parent 'II pretend to forgot the truth about your child's sexuality, you would never really know your child. A large part of his or her life would be kept secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person. It is important to accept and understand your child's sexuality because homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through ""a phase"". On the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation. So if you're wondering, ""Is she/he sure?"" the answer will almost always be ""yes""!

St. Louis police fatally shot a black teenager while trying to issue search warrant On Wednesday, Aug. 19 racial tensions again sparked in Missouri city after St. Louis police officers fatally shot black teenager at Walton Avenue and Page Boulevard while trying to issue search warrant. According to St. Louis Police Chief San Dotson, a young black man pointed a gun at officers and was trying to escape from a house where officers were carrying out a search warrant for him. The 33-year-old and 20-year-old officers who shot the suspect four times were about seven years on the force. That was followed by crowd of 150 people who gathered by intersection. Later on, nine people were arrested on charges of resisting arrest. The protesters said that the police provoked the situation. What do you think about it? What if this situation makes us want to keep the police out of our neighborhood? Why do you think police shoots first and then asks questions? Do you realize that the shooting came just ten days after St. Louis was flooded with protesters who were marking the anniversary of Michael Brown? What if the city and the government needs to center its attention on racism and discrimination in America instead of suspecting every single black men? We cannot accept the fact that police can easily kill black people in America, than we must do something about it. Protest or accept it. You choose.

Several officers responded to a call for assistance and eventually subdued and handcuffed Conerly. They then rebuked several bystanders who had declined to intervene. Bystanders are not liable to prosecution if the failure to render aid ""was reasonable under the circumstances,"" but the burden of demonstrating that this is the case is placed upon the accused.

They were young and Black- that was enough for police officers to decide that they looked suspicious. The police brutality has sparked the movement and has emerged to demand justice and political attention. However, the everyday racism we see was not understood, but ignored. Moreover, the government along with the law enforcement violate our rights through the illegal use of force and mass arrests in order to obstruct our free expression. Yes, standing up for your right to protest for the equality and justice is challenging, but it's worth discrimination and unfairness black civilians face everyday. Remember, knowing your rights can be the most powerful weapon you have against police abuse and brutality.

339,P(1)0002265,431,"Barack Obama and his team have spent two months working to secure 41 percent for Iran deal. And now they claim enourmous victory. Under the Constitution, treaties require the support of two-thirds of the Senate. The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect — a legally binding longterm agreement between sovereign powers, in which hundreds of billions of dollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed. Since this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been obliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41. Obama knows he can never get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in 2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and the Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama. But Obama is not stupid, he is very crafty politician. He succeded to change a subject to a vote — not of approval, like a treaty, but of disapproval. It would be treated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and the Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his presidential veto. The Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to overturn such a veto — and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So, instead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67 senators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or more Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember, 41 Senators agree to support the deal. Thus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will simply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking and obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42 percent. Barack Obama is very smart man, but he is not a patriot. He doesn't care about Americans.

Organizers of the Million Man March call for justice, standing against the police and for blacks, Latinos and incarcerated. They say racism rises among the police officers, but in fact it rises among radical groups. Only black activists say ""black lives matter"", forgetting the fact that justice is when all lives matter. Americans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the law, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes over the speed limit, he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the immigration law, he should be deported. If somebody kills a man, he should be imprisoned. Given the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in Ferguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan's benevolent intentions. This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim communities. This is a bad idea, especially if we take into account the recent news about British jihadi who have published the address of the Navy Seal Robert O'Neill, the man who fatally shot Osama bin Laden, and called on American extremists to execute him.

I march to fix a system that houses more black men in our prison system than there were black men enslaved in 1850. To fix a system that allows for local prosecutors to investigate their friends at the police department when there is an officer-involved shooting. To fix a system that has drug laws that disproportionately arrest black and brown people for using drugs when white people use at the same rate. To fix a system that has built a private industry off the backs of prisoners laboring for pennies. To fix a system that doesn't video record the actions of law enforcement at all times. To fix a system that criminalizes young women who are pimped and sexually trafficked before they even turn 18. To fix a system that does not collect any national data on incidents when police use excessive force or discharge their firearm. To fix a system that has incarcerated more people than any other nation in the world. To fix a system that has created a school to prison pipeline by harsher school discipline practices for young students of color. To fix a system of policing that targets communities of color by programs like ""Stop & Frisk"" or ""Broken Windows."" This is why I march.

428,P(1)0002097,317,"Mass Shooting At Umpqua Community College In Oregon, 10 Reported Dead Ten people were killed and seven were wounded Thursday in a shooting at a small community college in Roseburg, Oregon. The shooting took place in classrooms in Snyder Hall. Law enforcement officials have identified Chris Harper Mercer as the man responsible for the mass shooting.He had four weapons on him - three handguns and one assault weapon. Also he was definitely ready to put up a fight, because he had body armor and stash of ammunition. One of the witnesses said that the gunman first asked about people's religions before he began firing. The hospital said that all victims were female between the ages of 18 and 34, and quoted a doctor who said that an ""army"" of doctors and nurses had volunteered to help. It's the 45th shooting at a school so far this year. Obama said that America is the only country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months. And he's right. People already got used to this. Isn't it time for some gun control yet? Some white supremacists say that the killer was mixed and he supported BLM. This information is not confirmed and is more likely to be fake. This dude is definitely not black. His parents are Caucasian. The fact it's been a few hours since the shooting and they haven't say what race he is means he's white. And honestly, word ""shooting"" isn't used correctly here. Can we call it terror? Oh, wait.

But al-Qaida — even after its leader Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. commandos — has spawned cells elsewhere and inspired other extremists in Syria and Iraq. And now ISIS is rising as the most powerful terrorist organisation in the world.

Can you imagine that a group of armed men took over a federal property and have vowed to kill if they are forced to leave there unless the government change the law in their favor. Nonsense! The ongoing Oregon standoff has taught us is that it's never been more apparent that the U.S. government values white lives above all others. The most stark example is comparing the kid-gloves treatment the white gunmen in Oregon are getting with the 1985 bombing of the MOVE house in Philadelphia. #GunmeninOregon #TheMove #1985Bombing,https://www.facebook.com/WiIIiamsandKalvin/,"United States Interests: BlackNews.com, HuffPost Politics or HuffPost Black Voices",,18 - 54,,News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices,,7.452,554,"1,000.00 RUB",01/21/16 03:53:21 AM PST,01/23/16 03:53:21 AM PST,2016-01

In addition, more than half of the US's governors have said they will no longer provide placement for Syrian refugees, arguing that they pose too great a risk to national security. New Jersey governor and Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie has said his state will not take in any refugees — ""not even orphans under the age of five"". Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal has said he has directed state police to ""track"" the Syrian refugees in his state, something his state police have played down. GOP presidential hopefuls Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush have suggested the US government prioritize Christian refugees. Barack Obama has pledged to veto the legislation, and has condemned the anti-refugee comments as ""un-American"", but experts worry the backlash could have dangerous consequences if these claims go unchecked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-01

Oh wonderful, so she admits she wants to be the second Obama, like the first one isn't enough. And we know what's behind this world ""children"" — young men who claim to be less than 18. Same way the ""illegals without a criminal record"" is also those who are not proved to be criminals yet. Crossing the U.S. border without permission is already a crime. A crime that should bring just one simple punishment — deportation and a prohibition of further entrance. We do not need a president who doesn't understand that.

Authorities are reviewing surveillance video of the reported attack, which occurred shortly after 3 a.m. Saturday at the Kwik Shop at 4820 E. 21 st St. That's just northeast of the Wichita State University campus. One of the victims was Khondonkor Usama, Muslim 23, the second victim, is a 19-year-old student who has chosen to remain anonymous. They were getting gas and snacks at about 3 a.m. Saturday when they noticed a man shouting at someone who had apparently asked him for gas money. When the suspect began using racial slurs against the man who asked him for money, one of the students attempted to intervene. The attacker then turned his wrath on the two students, stopping his motorcycle in front of Usama's car and approaching Usama's friend, who had gotten out of the car. The suspect called his friend ""brown trash"" and told him he had to ""leave this country,"" According to Usama's account, his friend responded: ""This is my country. Who the hell are you to tell me to leave?"" The incident ""escalated really quick,"" with the suspect attempting to punch his friend, Usama said. When he attempted to break up the fight, Usama said he was assaulted and knocked down. He called 911, and as he was on the phone the attacker rode circles around the two students, chanting ""Trump! Trump! Trump!"" and screaming, ""We'll make America great again!

We didn't forget who supported the war in Iraq, we are Muslims and Americans, so we know your support to invade Iraq in 2003 have caused hundreds of American soldiers to die hundreds of miles away from their homes, and also millions of Iraqi Muslims, including innocent men, women and children, to die in their homes, and for what? Libya! You supported bombing and destroying the whole country just to kill AIGaddafi. You said in an interview: ""We came, we saw, he died"". Let's not forget about Benghazi, where you declined to increase the embassy security, and that caused the death of the U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and Ten others were also injured in the attacks. You killed Saddam Hussein and AI-Gaddafi in Iraq and Lybia leaving the countries there in chaos, which led to the birth of ISIS, which is now a threat not only to the U.S. but the whole world! You are supporting gun control, disarming the American citizens and at the same time selling weapons to groups in the Middle East to fight their leaders, creating on the short run terrorist groups as we saw in Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. 8 years ago you were against refugees, but now you support them. 10 years ago you were against same sex marriage, but now you support it.

THINGS HAVE BEEN VERY SILENT ON HIS BEHALF The 31-year-old black man died Feb. 20 at Fairfield Medical center after he had a °medical episode' at the jail when deputies were moving Ariel J. Clark from one cell to another. According to police reports; Ariel J. Clark, 31 was too combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest. On February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark; reporting that Clark, who was driving his wife and two children from Buffulo to Texas, was threatening to kill him and his son. Clark's wife said that a man and his son began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he hadn't slept in five days. When the police arrived. Clark was arrested, taken to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint chair for his combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some breathing difficulties and deputies started chest compression. But an hour later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital. An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail inmate. Now the question is whether the jail's standard operating procedures were followed. We would like to see a true picture of what he looked like after ""fighting"" with the police. Also, we would like to see the picture of him when he arrived at hospital.

It started in North Carolina but it can spread all over the country. Blacks are being deprived of general voting rights. The U.S. District Judge, Thomas Schroeder, on Monday dismissed lawsuits challenging changes to the state's election laws, declaring that the challenges failed to show that it hindered voters of color from exercising their voting rights. The North Carolina law which eliminated early voting, same —day voter registration and out-of-precinct voting requires voters who go to the polls to show an acceptable form of identification such as a driver's license, passport or military ID. This is not a good sign as we watch the world take the new turn for the worse now while doing nothing.

Brown was driving back home; when MorsiMurphy jumped out of the car and approached her yelling curse words and demanding she move the vehicle back. When Brown reached for her license; Lopez pointed a gun at her head. Moreover, Lopez WAS LAUGHTING at poor Brown; who was beat and pepper-sprayed by police. Brown is not the only victim, her kids had suffered from pepper spray too. The US police is just insane. What's the problem with peaceful arrest? Why the hell they treat us as animals?

Could you imagine how off-duty deputy Tracy Weiss was shocked when she realized that her budge won't protect her from paying parking fines? Her face is priceless. The story happened last month when Weiss found her car being towed for illegal parking. The cop jumped into another vehicle to block the driver, who had towed her car. When she exited the vehicle she had her gun drawn. The driver started recording the incident when he understood that his life is under threat. That's how $62.50 fine turned into $125. The sheriff's office said Weiss has been an Orange County deputy for 11 years and they are investigating the incident. I have only one question: is that how PD trains police in our country? For 11 years she should know how to fix the situation like that. The only reason she should identify herself as an officer is to explain why she has a holstered weapon. Aside from that she should not have mentioned it nor should she have drawn the weapon. To my mind, this woman need to stop being a deputy and carrying a gun. Such cops and people as well should stay away from guns. This would give our citizens a chance to get back home alive.

There's a kind of code of silence, even if you saw something or just know something about other police officer, you keep silence about it. But if you are in a member of a club, you can be sure that no one will ever let your secrets out. Statistically, 46% of cops admit to witnessing misconduct by other cops! Also, 73 % of the individuals pressuring officers to keep quiet about the misconduct are leaders. 8% of the officers who admitted to intentionally withholding the information about officer misconduct were upper administrators. Cops will always lie to suit interaction or conversation. Sadly enough,""Sworn officer of the court"" is most likely to lie than the citizen he is even accusing. So, the lie is a norm for the officers who are keeping the code of silence, and it's a miracle if a police officer tells the truth.

The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do literally nothing without using their guns. Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with chemical and electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing their job."" All those things and more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America. Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is why cops are so violent now.

Johnson was a black U.S. military veteran of the Afghan war. As he was captured, he claimed he wanted to ""kill white people"". There's no evidence that he was a Black Lives Matters activist. There's no proof that he was into the movement anyhow. It happened almost a week ago and the police can't show anything to prove there was a link between Micah X. Johnson and Black Lives matter.

Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on the passenger's side. When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man briefly lying unconscious on the ground. The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?

In yet another disturbing video of police escalating violence in a public school, a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense altercation with a student. According to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim, Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom. The student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a brief clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him. I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more then a bunch of bullies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide something and their testimony should be considered a lie.

We had a moment to present economic or social advancement plans to president Obama, yet we refused and let anti- blacks trick us into thinking that was not elected to benefit just black people alone. President Obama was elected for a reason. He was the stepping stone for blacks to rise but it was blown away. Now, it is the time of White America to rebuild and advance and make their race great. The war for power between blacks and whites is very real, but the black community has forgotten. Consequently, the power of black is fading day by day because those in position are descending from the ladder every day. In no time; ""White Power' will be stronger than before.

Cops here in America play God. They believe they are judge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law, it is their job to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their eyes. It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will get away with it.

The corrupt media does not talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it mention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some outdated tapes featuring Trump.

We are free citizens of Texas and we've had enough of this cheap show on the screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and gun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but not without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher taxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist attacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let's remind them what Texas is made of and show that we're ready to SECEDE!

Defending the police against liberal and racist accusations is a solemn duty of every American Patriot. Recent spate of cop killings indicates that American national identity is undermined and replaced by ridiculous social experiments liberal elites are constantly setting up on the country.

They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and challenge police brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the government and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party ""the greatest threat to the internal security of the country"". They tried to close it, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was dissolved. 50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country stills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. It spreads through all the country like the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before.

And here are some real Clinton decisions: —Last year, Clinton claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had been exaggerated by Republicans. —In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007 supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans' medical care. -In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20 million for veterans' health care facilities. -In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for 113 billion for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits."" In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they need so bad! Hardly will she change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a direct threat to the American veterans' society, but still practically no one raises these concerns.

2183,P(1)0002859,1051,"CHARLESTON COP WHO FATALLY SHOT BLACK MAN ASKS JUDGE TO DROP CHARGES, CITING DOUBLE RISK North Charleston police officer Michael Slager, who shot and killed 50-yearold Scott after an April 2015 traffic stop, and his attorneys urged the court to drop murder charge due to the double jeopardy that Slager faced before the shooting. According to ex-cop's attorneys, their defendant acted in selfdefense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times, hitting Scott five times from behind. Slager's defense attorney's: ""The double-teaming of Slager ... is a chilling example of how far politically motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather their own nests at the expense of a public servant ... who had to make a splitsecond life or death decision that will be second-guessed by comfortable armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.' The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager's dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a bystander's video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire. We've seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none of them found guilty. That's why today it's important to send a message to other police officers that if they do this, it's harsh penalty to pay.",https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/,"United States Interests: Pan-Africanism, African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954-68), African-American history or Black (Color)",,16 - 65+,English (UK) or English (US),News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices,,36.295,"6,656",500.00 RUB,11/03/16 08:11:51 AM PDT,11/10/16 07:11:51 AM PST,2016-11

Police arrived at the scene after a series of 911 calls in which they were warned of a reckless driver and her erratic behavior. When cop saw Shirley, who was off her bipolar medication, they boxed her in with their patrol cars. When she started approaching them, law enforcement officers opened fire at her. The incident resulted in a fatal shooting. After the shooting, Shirley was taken to County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and was pronounced dead. Michelle Shirley, 39, who received a diagnosis of a mental disorder tried to balance motherhood and law school.

2291,P(1)0005753,3157,"Joshua was born in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in Indianapolis. Two months before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two sons. Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in Indianapolis at the age of 26. Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an offduty firefighter. The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said. Suddenly, Boxley said, a car cut her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her off — who she believed was a Chicago police officer — stopped and got out of their cars. At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley. She said the man got inside his car but exited again and ""he just started shooting,"" hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal legally owned the gun and did not fire it. Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began shooting him. ""I was hoping my brother wasn't dead,"" said Boxley. Beal's mother said he was a father to two children, a 4-year-old and a 2-yearold, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother. ""This is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They have no consideration for life,"" - Tiffaney Boxley. Yet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will say, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own death, armed or unarmed. #joshuabeal #altonsterling #TerenceCrutcher #westandtogether #blacklivesmatter #unite4justice",https://www.facebook.com/Woke-Blacks-294234600956431/,"- Living In: United States Interests: Martin Luther King, Jr., African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954-68), African-American history or Malcolm X",,,,,,,,,,,2016-11

He finally passed the bar exams in Michigan and Washington, DC after waiting many years to be approved by the respective boards. Afterwards, Manville worked tirelessly to improve the prison system and represented various inmates and prison guards in civil cases.

Henderson was later apprehended and imprisoned for 10 years after one of his men was caught carrying a big shipment. It was in prison that he discovered his natural flair for cooking, while he was on kitchen duty. He was released early for good behavior and soon started working for some of LA's top restaurants before venturing into Las Vegas. After experiencing many rejections due to his felonious past, Henderson finally managed to land a job at Caesar's Palace. It was only a matter of time before he finally started getting recognition and awards, including best Las Vegas Chef in 2001.

The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned braids and twists amidst the criticism. Some of the female soldiers used harsh chemicals to keep their hair straight. Moreover, every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus, the ban on dreadlocks caused a lot of unnecessary stress. The ban on locs, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until January 2017.

If most of the people going into the system are black men, most of my clients will be too."" The Duke Journal of Gender Law and Policy hosted a symposium Tuesday focusing on efforts to improve criminal justice and the American prison system. Titled ""Intersectionality and the Black Lives Matter Movement,"" the event featured a panel of speakers, including James Coleman, John S. Bradway professor of the practice of law, and Umar Muhammad, community organizer for the Southern Coalition for Justice, along with Theresa Newman, clinical professor of law. ""I didn't feel prepared for the world. I didn't feel rehabilitated. I had no","esources,"" Muhammad said. -The Chronicle https://www.facebook.com/Hell_and_Back-1806743482876111/",- Living In: United States,,18 - 65+,,News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices,"Interests: Corrections Corporation of America, American Correctional Association or The Inmates",0,0,None,02/13/17 07:31:36 AM PST,02/14/17 07:31:36 AM PST,2017-02

2748,P(1)0000842,2461,"""First and foremost, we as Chicago Public School students would like to thank you for the supportive donation to our schools. As we all know, CPS has been struggling financially, and your donation has really given us a push to get to where we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the community as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to improve our Chicago... All of the things that you do for our city never go unnoticed. All of the free concerts you host and all the time you spend here in the city really show you care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility away from artists, but it hasn't changed you... We thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others have put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored and as though we don't have enough support from bigger influences like you. Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers due to the frequent violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be successful, still be self-made... Once again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the city we know and love, Chicago. Sincerely, Alex Rojas, Alondra Cerros, and Annelisse Betancourt Lake View High School Students Chicago, Illinois"" It's not the full letter, but some extracts. It's sweet to observe how young people don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who cares for them. We are sure, that Chano needs it. Love should be given back. It should work. As an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn't forget who made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people's love. That's cool that this love goes back and forth! We need more of these positive black people on the media, because some people forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day different race will be the issue of diversity, not stereotypes. #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #chancetherapper #chicago #music #hiphop #rap",https://www.facebook.com/iloveblackexcellence,- Living In: United States,,18 - 65+,,News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices,"Interests: Martin Luther King, Jr., My Black is Beautiful, Black is beautiful or Black Girls Rock!",,,,,,2017-03

When cops stopped him ; Hollins was seen on video standing with his hands raised before one of the officers was seen punching the motorist in his face; and the second cop racing to the scene later, only to stomp Hollins in his face. The 21-year-old man said he feared for his life when he saw police approach him. Hollins raised his hands up in order to let him know that he didn't have anything where he could hurt him, but police beat him. Moreover, after the incident cops wrote in their police report that Hollins resisted arrest and claimed that Hollins refused to place his hands behind his back and resisted arrest. Cops literally lied and had no shame. This incident embarrassed and the Gwinnett County police and all law enforcement. They should be held accountable for their actions. Resignation is not the answer. We did not hear any criminal charges. even though they admit the cops broke the law. Where is the justice?

The situation escalated quickly when the police officer demanded King to roll down her window ""all the way"" to receive her ticket. When King refused, which by the way was a perfectly legal thing to do, the police officer broke out the car window and arrested her in a brutal way. Instead of simply citing her, the police officer demanded the woman to obey and threw her to the ground. When you're Black no violation is small enough.

The second coalition strike on a town near the Iraqi border killed 23 more civilians. Just to make it clear: our government is proposing spending cuts to most government agencies to pay for large increases in military, and everything we got from this is more and more civilians deaths. EPA, State and other development programs, Agriculture, Labor, Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and many other domestic agencies faced more than 20% cuts in their budgets, and only the Department of Defense has grown by 10%.

Here's what Ron Paul thinks about it: ""By the end of this month, Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor HR McMaster will deliver to President Trump their plans for military escalations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. President Trump would be wise to rip the plans up and send his national security team back to the drawing board — or replace them. There is no way another ""surge"" in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus a new one in Syria) puts America first. There is no way doing the same thing over again will succeed any better than it did the last time.""

Sadly days after days and weeks after weeks of Trump's presidency there are no changes in that direction. Israel captured a Syrian region named Golan Heights in 1967, and today this land is internationally considered to be occupied territory. Israelis want to use Trump's influence so the world would acknowledge Israeli sovereignty. Trump is a dealer, and maybe he's trying make a deal out of it, but there's one important thing here: under no circumstances can our soldiers' lives be put at risk for that.

These videos and instances have become so common that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now, karma's coming back for blue pigs! A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two officers for seemingly no reason. The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do literally nothing without using their guns. Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with chemical and electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing their job."" All those things and more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America. Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is why cops are so violent now.

3437,P(1)0004831,2415,"New administration's budget proposal to Congress includes $1.7 trillion in mandatory spending cuts over 10 years, including $800 billion from Medicaid and $193 billion from food stamps. At the same time, this proposal, called ""A New Foundation for American Greatness"", includes a boost in military spending and $1.6 billion for the construction of the border wall with Mexico. To be honest, I'm not sure, that the wall and another pointless war, instead of affordable health care and help for those in need, is what we have to keep our focus on. It seems like republicans are using every single possibility to get more money for their wars, and they don't mind it if average Americans live in poverty or without affordable medicine. Why additional billions to Military? Our Department of Defense budget is already bigger than military budgets of the next eight countries combined, isn't it enough? Here is what Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""Based on what we know about this budget, the good news -- the only good news -- is that it's likely to be roundly rejected by members of both parties here in the Senate — just as the last budget was""",https://www.facebook.com/bornliberal/,United States,,18 - 65+,,News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices,"People who like Born Liberal, Friends of connections: Friends of people who are connected to Born Liberal","1,778",267,267.00 RUB,05/23/17 07:36:32 AM PDT,05/25/17 07:36:32 AM PDT,2017-05

Not a small sum, it's roughly equal to the entire annual military budget of France, larger than the defense budgets of the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan, and only $12 billion less than the entire Russian military budget of 2015. But what about domestic and State Department spending? For example, such an increase for the Department of Defense means 31% cut in the EPA's budget and a 29% cut in the State Department. In other words, it's a great number of opportunities squandered in favor of the interests of highpowerful warmongers in our government. Environment, diplomacy, alternative energy, housing or infrastructure repair? Not today. Today they want thousands of peaceful people to die for their money interests.
