The AP's lawyers late Friday formally asked the State Department to hasten that effort so that the department could provide all Clinton's minute-by-minute schedules by Oct. 15. The agency did not immediately respond. The schedules drew new attention this week after the AP analyzed the ones released so far. The news agency found that more than half the people outside the government who met or spoke by telephone with Clinton while she was secretary of state had given money — either personally or through companies or groups — to the Clinton Foundation. The AP's analysis focused on people with private interests and excluded her meetings or calls with U.S. federal employees or foreign government representatives. The AP's reporting was based on official calendars covering Clinton's entire term plus the more-detailed daily schedules covering roughly half her time as secretary of state. The AP first asked for Clinton's calendars in 2010 and again in 2013. It then sued the State Department in federal court to obtain the detailed schedules

 well over half of all the people not working for the government who met with Hillary Clinton during her tenure as Secretary of State gave cash to the Clinton Foundation. The AP reported: It’s actually worse than that – this count didn’t include representatives of 16 governments that gave $170 million to the Foundation. The Associated Press also revealed that many of these people asked her for help directly. While the AP mentioned that the meetings “do not appear to violate legal agreements Clinton and former president Bill Clinton signed before she joined the State Department in 2009	” it’s clear that the Clinton Foundation and State Department essentially acted as a giant clearing house for Clinton favors and cash.

 “Shirts” The Hillary Clinton campaign has at least two ads attacking Donald Trump for outsourcing the production of his merchandise. Given Trump’s rhetoric against companies shipping jobs out of the United States — he vowed not to eat Oreo cookies anymore after Nabisco moved some U.S. factory jobs to Mexico — this is a frequent attack on his record as a businessman. Trump has a long history of outsourcing a variety of his products and has acknowledged doing so. When asked during a Republican primary debate in Miami why voters should trust that Trump “will run the country differently from how you run your businesses	” he answered: “Because nobody knows the system better than me. … I’m a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We’re allowed to do it. … I’m the one that knows how to change it.” Trump also encouraged outsourcing to students of Trump University

 “under-employment equilibrium”? How is that working out for minorities and the overall middle-class? Most of the jobs are low paying. You have to work two jobs just to make ends meet. The labor force is being under utilized—too many people working chump change jobs. According to Gallup’s recent data unemployment is at 9.7% which is the percentage of people who can’t find ‘good jobs’ (Gallup defines a good job as 30+ hours per week for an employer who provides a regular paycheck). And why is all this happening? The dirty little secret is that we have lost 50	000 manufacturers which provided good jobs not to mention a failure to rebuild the infrastructure and put in high-speed rail systems. We are slouching our way to a third world country. And what does this mean for minorities? Absolute hell! The Democrat Party is the Titanic Party.
